(THIS WAS MADE IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2021)


``Doesn't work anymore because the addresses and offsets keep changing with every patch``


# Valheim_UnlimitedStaminaMod
This app makes it so your character will always have max stamina via adding stamina constantly.


How was this project made:

  1- Finding the address of the value in memory
  
  2- Finding the offsets and tracking the offsets from the main value.
  
  3- Accessing the memory using python
  
  4- Accessing the memory using the offsets found in step 2
  
  5- Then finally changing the value continually to achieve unlimited stamina
